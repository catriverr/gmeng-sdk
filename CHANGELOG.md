**28/09/2024 (info)** - repository cleanup
> CODE_OF_CONDUCT and CONTRIBUTING have been moved to the `.github` directory
> so the repository is less packed.<br> The `.clangd` file has also been removed as it previously remained unused.

**25/09/2024 (info)** - swapped to `Zlib License`
> Gmeng now uses the Zlib License as it better fits its use cases.

**25/09/2024 (info)** - added `CHANGELOG.md`
> I will now be logging changes to the engine to this file since we have a stable version of Gmeng (currently version 9.1.0)
