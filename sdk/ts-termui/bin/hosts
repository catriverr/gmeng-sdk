DEF glist [GLOBAL-DOMAINS]
# Global list is for domains that are already registered in the global domain name servers, such as google.com.
# when glist is being loaded, the system will try to connect to all members within glist category
#
# for a server to be recognized as a working domain in dnscli, all servers must have a /dnscli-data path 
# that gives the json response to a get request as:
# 
# {
#   "domain_name": "domain name that redirects to this server in dnscli. use '*' to use global domain name",
#   "domain_holder": "Corporation or domain holder's name"
# }
#  
# if no other saves of the domain_name exists within /bin/tree/domain_names, it will be accessible.
# if there is a domain_name save within /bin/tree/domain_names, the server can not start. 
# So, modifying this list is highly discouraged.

# Partiers are lists of domains that are connected to a single domain within dnscli that have subdomains.
# syntax being: 
# PARTIER-domainname: domain-global-ip = subdomainname /path-to-subdomain-server | ...
# an example would be:
# PARTIER-HELLOWORLD: 43.68.978.211 = firstsubdomain.helloworld.dns /path | secondsubdomain.helloworld.dns /path2
